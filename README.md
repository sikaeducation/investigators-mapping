# Sika Investigators: Mapping

You're making the new Sika website, and need to include an interactive map showing its location. You could code the map from scratch, but this is a problem that's been solved many times by many people, so why not reuse their work? Find and use a mapping library to add an interactive map to the included site. Your map should be centered on a Denver public library at an appropriate zoom level and display the name of the location on a marker.
